# Buying a House in Melbourne, Victoria (or Australia?)

Oh dear god this was a pain so I'm hoping that if I've linked you this document (or that you've found this through a Google search or random browsing), that it's of some sufficient helpfulness because there's an awful amount of individual research and talking-to-people one needs to do on their own. ðŸ™„

This is written assuming you're a clueless first-home buyer who wants to purchase their first property. I won't define all the terms here, but give an outline of the overall process.

## 1. Budget

Here there are probably two main things to figure out at this initial stage

1. How much savings you have.
2. What is an approximate price range of the type of property you're looking at.

There are two 'milestones' in terms of the initial deposit percentage that you should be aware of:

* 5% - this is the bare minimum that you should be able to afford, but this still does not necessarily guarantee that you'll be in the all-clear. 
* 20%+ - the reason for this is that it avoids what's called 'Lenders Mortgage Insurance' which avoids you paying more for the opportunity to borrow more. In general this is probably a moot point if you have a stable high-paying job.

If it's not obvious, the more you have for your initial deposit, the easier things will be, basically.

## 2. Contacting a broker

Why?
