# Icebreaker Questions

Hello and welcome to my compilation of icebreaker questions that are in alignment with my type of humour (mostly sardonic). 

Features are:
* They address something that most people don't normally think about, but for those who do, tend to have strong opinions on.
* For some questions the responses should be purposely decisive, one-or-the-other, no middle ground.

## Food

People are very passionate about their food, apparently.

### How would you eat a full head of iceberg lettuce?

1. Peel the leaves off and eat them one at a time?
2. Bite into it like an apple.

Note: Samuel L Jackson answered in a radio interview that he would eat it like an apple.

### How do you usually eat pizza?

1. With your hands.
2. With eating utensils (knife & fork, chopsticks, etc.)

Notes: The original food piece was 'fish and chips'. Can also replace with other foods (e.g. chicken nuggets) that can be eaten either way, or of which one or the other is still more favoured, but others might choose the other for specific reasons (e.g. Some South-East Asians use chopsticks for everything, including snack foods like chips, because they don't want to get their hands dirty).

### Is a hotdog a sandwich?

1. Yes
2. No

Notes: Hot dog can be replaced by any of the options mentioned on this [Cube Rule website](https://cuberule.com/) (e.g. Subway sub, piece of chicken between two waffles) that lays out the origin of the meme and how it's developed from there.

### What do you call a long piece of boneless chicken, battered and fried?

1. Chicken Fingers
2. Chicken Strips
3. Chicken Tenders/Tendies
4. Chicken Goujons
5. Something else

Notes: Goujons is an European term. Chicken tenders/tendies refer to pieces made from the tenderloin part of the chicken. You usually find chicken fingers in the frozen section of the supermarket, but chickens technically don't have fingers. KFC have chicken strips as part of their menu.

### Pineapple on Pizza?

1. Yay!
2. Nay.

### Where should the lettuce be placed in a hamburger?

1. Underneath the patty.
2. Above the patty.

Notes: When I first saw this question the asker was adamant about the lettuce being under the burger to prevent the bread being soggy from the patty juices. 

Source: This is an in-joke from a local Discord, but it definitely fits the 'things most people don't think about' criteria.

## Other

### How many holes does a straw have?

1. Zero
2. One
3. Two

Notes: Ask your respondents on how they'd define holes. Then ask them how many holes a t-shirt has, then a pair of pants, then keep throwing more toplogical objects at them. What about a bowl? Does a bowl have one or zero holes?

### How much would I need to bribe you to try wearing socks in the shower?

1. None, I'd try it for free!
2. $1
3. $10
4. $100
5. $1,000
6. You could never get me to try wearing socks in the shower.

Notes: This is another in-joke. But some people enjoyed it, apparently.

## Would You Rather...

A quick google search should give you plenty of 'Would You Rather' questions to choose from. The ones I've chosen below generally tend to be a choice between two slightly unwieldy/uncomfortable situations.

* Would you rather have one nipple or two belly buttons?
* Would you rather have eyebrows that never stop growing, or eyelashes that never stop growing?
* Would you rather be trapped in a small room with 10,000 tarantulas for 10 minutes, or eat 10 tarantulas in 10 minutes?
* Would you rather kiss a cobra or kiss a jellyfish?
