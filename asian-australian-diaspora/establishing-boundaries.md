The problem Dr. Salihaa Fridi addresses is when children (raised in individualistic Western culture) feel like they're being imposed on when parents (and older relatives) thrust advice on them, of which there are two aspects to it:

1. The advice is unsolicited.
2. The advice is expressed in a way that is initially perceived as offensive and/or offending.

Common scenarios: Children being told what they should do/eat/pursue as a career, a new mother being given baby advice, etc.

As a result, within the individualist culture mindset one may feel somewhat smothered and want to establish some boundaries/distance from said people. 

There were three main takeaways from the Instagram vid:

1. Identify which bit is bothering you: is it the way they say things, is it the unsolicited advice (when you already know what you're going to do), etc.
2. Realise that they do this because this is what they grew up being exposed to i.e. they're merely repeating the behaviour of their parents and may not necessarily know any better way to communicate things.
3. If you already know what works best for you but are still getting advice, it's OK to just listen (to humour them), then just go do what you already know works best.
