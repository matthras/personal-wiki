In general this category is for documenting the typical struggles between first-generation Asian immigrants and their children from my own perspective. Usual disclaimer that everything I write here is from my perspective.

My mother is Chinese-Malaysian, and my father is Chinese, although his actual Chinese origins are not known. My younger brother and I are Australian-born and while my parents have always tried to equally expose us to both cultures both my brother and I have diverged, with me favouring the more individualistic Western culture, and my brother favouring Asian (Eastern) culture. 

This has no doubt resulted in clashes which I've spent a long time mediating and figuring out, and only now in my 30s am in a comfortable situation where I've figured out things enough to properly document them here. 

So here goes!
