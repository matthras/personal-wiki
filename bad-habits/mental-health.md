# Slumps

## Forgetting-To-Take-My-Pills-Induced Slump

Very rarely (once every couple of months) I'll have a day where I forget to take my antidepressants and/or Vitamin D supplements.

For reference, I normally take (correct as of 15/12/2020, and has been for the past few years):

* Vitamin D supplement (1000IU) and 1x Fish Oil capsule in the morning with my morning drink or breakfast
* Antidepressants (200mg Desfax/Pristiq) in the evening around 9-10pm with my evening drink (usually tea or water), before I go to bed.

### Why/How does this happen?

* Distractions around the usual times that I would normally take either medication
  * [14/12/2020 - Monday] Calls from real estate agents distracted me from taking my morning supplements, which led to an afternoon slump and me forgetting to take my antidepressants in the evening. Didn't realise until Tuesday morning.
* Lots of things weighing on my mind distracting me from my regular activities.

### How is this resolved? What usually happens?

Usually I take my antidepressants and/or supplements at the earliest opportunity upon recognising my mistake, and then stick to my normal routine. However, expect a day of not being productive, and it usually takes half-a-day to a day to get back to normal. 

### How can I prevent this problem from happening in future?

The general proactive approach is to ensure I'm in a life situation where things are regular enough for me to consistently maintain my routine. Right now this is happening because there's a lot of ebbs and flows with respect to my work/life situation where often in high-stress and/or heavy-work periods it's very easy to forget the basics and occasionally jump out of routine. This isn't very easy for me to anticipate in advance because of lack of experience with certain work/study tasks and not knowing how much effort/time they take, but this is no doubt something that I'll improve on with more experience.

## Lack-of-Direction-or-Work Slump

Essentially if I don't have work or anything external to put me into a routine, and have too many consecutive days at home on my own without something/someone (or some regular obligation) telling me what to do, it's easy for me to hit either a depressive or restless slump.

## Cabin Fever

In general most (if not all) of my preferred activities are done indoors and sometimes this results in stretches of days where I forget to get out of the house to get some fresh air and to just talk to people.

### How is this resolved?

In general, having regular activities where I do get out of the house e.g. shopping, eating out, work, etc. keeps this at bay. This kind of slump usually happens when I don't have work and/or external commitments and thus have too much time to myself and forget to keep up the 'regular going out' thing.
