# Personal Knowledge Wiki

This is just a place for me to centrally store everything in some version-checked way. Often times I have many different ideas and/or tidbits that I'd like to catalogue somewhere, so why not here?

This [particular post on dev.to](https://dev.to/elliebike/i-ve-started-a-personal-wiki-3cf) gave me the idea which I mulled over for a week or two before deciding to get this repo up and going.
